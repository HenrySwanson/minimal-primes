I got nerdsniped by this problem and did base 10 by hand, and then I got further into the rabbit hole and and am trying to see how far I can get by computer.

Some of these methods I found myself, but others I'm taking from a paper I found by Curtis Bright: https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cbright/reports/mepn.pdf

He's also got a GitHub repository here, which has been invaluable for testing my output: https://github.com/curtisbright/mepn-data/tree/master/data
