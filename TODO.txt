- Highest priority is to figure out more divisors of things. Splitting doesn't help much.
- Make Ctrl-C show the current situation
- Add gcd_mut method
- Can I skip the "contains prime" test when I'm solving a simple family?
- The biguint class comes with a "from digits" method, use that maybe?

Unsolved families:
- the last one in 8 is sum of cubes (2^3n + 1)
- the last one in 9 is funky, it's (9^(n+1) - 1) / 8
  - half of those factor as difference of squares
  - the other are just divisible by 2
- somehow in 16 i'm getting 0s at the beginning
